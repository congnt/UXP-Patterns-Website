UXP Patterns Website 
** Goal: 
-To expose few UXP pattern to everyone
-To create a "knowledge" database for UXP stuff based in a first time on our UXP Pattern.

So we started to build a website, by exporting our patterns from Google Doc to HTML and apply Bootstrap style.


** Roadmap:
- Make the HomePage clearer and more beautiful,
- Adapt HTML of patterns to make them very clear and easy to read,
- Adapt pattern to directly use Twitter Bootstrap component (for exemple, for the pagination or for modal errors...)
- Continue to export other patterns.

A repository named UXP Patterns Website is used to keep track all the work.
